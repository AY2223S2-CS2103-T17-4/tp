## About

*Fish Ahoy!* is a desktop CLI-focused application, designed to help users take better care of their
aquatic pets. It allows fish keepers to:

1. Keep track of their tanks and fishes in a hierarchical view, sorted by tanks.
2. Keep track of their fishes' attributes such as the last time it was fed and how often it needs to be fed
3. Consolidate fish-up-keeping tasks and automatically remind users to feed their fish according to information
given by the user

This developer guide aims to provide instructions and guidelines for developers to understand how to
effectively use and contribute to this project by explaining design considerations for certain key features. Moreover,
new developers can use this guide as an entry point for navigating this extensive code base.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `fish delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `MainContent`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Fish` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component 

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a fish).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FishDeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `FishAddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `FishAddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `FishAddCommandParser`, `TaskDeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.
* The 3 main types of `XYZCommandParser` are divided into command parsers for `Fish`, `Tank` and `Task`. 

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/FishTankTaskClassDiagram.png" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Fish` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueFishList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Fish` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Fish>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)
* the `Task` and `Tank` model is implemented similarly to the `Fish` part of the model.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Fish` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Fish` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Feature Implementations

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Automatic Feeding Reminders
#### Implementation

The entrypoint of this feature is in the `start()` method of MainApp, which is automatically called when the user opens
*Fish Ahoy!*. We then access the `Logic` component to access the `Model` component to find out which `Tank` have unfed
`Fish`. For each tank with unfed `Fish`, we create a `TaskFeedingReminder`. We then return an `ArrayList` of
`TaskFeedingReminders` as `feedingReminders`. In the `Logic` component, we create a `TaskFeedingReminderCommand` for
each `TaskFeedingReminder`, then execute these commands, updating the `Model` component before saving the states
if the various lists. 

![FeedingReminderSequenceDiagram](images/FeedingReminderSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:
* Alternative 1: Create a command parser and other relevant files to allow the user to execute this command
  * Pros: user can update Reminders without opening the app
  * Cons: will be redundant most of the times as Fish feeding intervals are not that short. Even if user calls this
command, the reminders likely do not need to be updated.

### FishSortCommand feature

#### Implementation
The fish sorting feature leverages `SortedList` functionality of Javafx. By creating custom comparators to compare fish
attributes, we are able to make a `SortedList` sort its list by the specified order.
Specifically, it currently sorts by the five compulsory fields of a fish:

* Name
* Last Fed Interval
* Species
* Feeding Interval
* Tank

Currently, upon instantiation of `ModelManager`, it creates a `Filteredlist` from a `AddressBook`. Similarly,
a `SortedList` is created based off the same `Filteredlist`. Hence, when we perform sorting operations, we are able to manipulate
the filtered list. As a result, `SortedList` has a separate panel from `FilteredList` and `Tank`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user is currently using the application, and there are three entries currently existing in the `AddressBook`, `Marlin, Nemo, Dory`, added in that order.

Step 2. The user executes `fish sort n`. `FishParser` receives the `sort` keyword and calls `FishSortCommandParser#parse()`,
in which the keyword `n` is used to select a Comparator. In this case, the `NameComparator`, which compares the names between fish,
is passed to `FishSortCommand` and returned.

![FishSortCommandDiagram](images/FishSortDiagram.png)

Step 3. `FishSortCommand#execute()` first calls `Model#sortFilteredFishList()`, which in turn calls `SortedList#setComparator()`.
This call triggers the SortedList to sort the current list using the given comparator. In this case, `Marlin, Nemo, Dory` sorts into `Dory, Marlin, Nemo`.

Step 4. `FishSortCommand#execute()` then calls `Model#setGuiMode()`, which triggers a GUI change in `MainWindow` to display the `SortedList` of `Dory, Marlin, Nemo`.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Where Sorting takes place :**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a SortedList and comparators to sort within the list.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Requires a separate list or wrapping.

* **Alternative 2:** Sorts a list externally before replacing the `AddressBook` list.
    * Pros: More customization and control over sorting.
    * Cons: Requires a duplicate list to be made each time.

### TaskAddCommand feature
#### Motivation
As a FishTracker application, on top of tracking fishes, we provide a way for fishkeepers to keep track of
their tasks such as changing of tank water or repairing certain tank equipments

#### Implementation
Adding a task can be done via the command "task add".
You are able to specify paramters like:
* Description
* Tank Index (to relate task to a tank)
* Priority Level (Low / Medium / High)

#### How `TaskAddCommand` is executed
When the command `task add <description>` is invoked it first goes through the main parser `AddressBookParser`, after
which it is delegated to command-specific parsers, namely TaskCommandParser -> TaskAddCommandParser.

Thus, `LogicManager` will invoke `execute` on `TaskAddCommand` with the following code
`command.execute(model);`, where `model.addTask(taskToAdd)` will be called.

![TaskAddDiagram](images/TaskAddDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Create a parser for task commands and a taskAdd parser for add-specific task commands
    * Pros: Easy to manage TaskList functionalities. 
    * Cons: May have performance issues due to numerous calls down command-specific parsers

* Alternative 2 : Use a simple
    * Pros: Easy to implement
    * Cons: Not well abstracted. Difficult to implement other task commands in the future like marking / deleting of
    tasks



### TankFeedCommand feature
#### Motivation
As a FishTracker application, we provide a way for fishkeepers to track the `LastFedDates` of all their fishes,
as having multiple tanks and fishes makes feeding difficult to keep track of without a tracking system.

#### Implementation summary
As such, every `Fish` contains a `LastFedDate` object, which contains a date field which records their `lastFedDate`.

When the fishkeeper decides to feed a particular tank by invoking the command `tank feed <index>`,
the program will feed all fishes in that tank, changing `LastFedDate`  of all fishes in that tank.

#### How `TankFeedCommand` is executed
When a command `tank feed <index>` is invoked, it first passes through the main parser `AddressBookParser`,
before being delegated to command-specific parsers, namely `TankParser` -> `TankFeedCommandParser`,
which returns a `TankFeedCommand` to `LogicManager`.

With this, `LogicManager` will invoke `execute` on `TankFeedCommand` with the following code `command.execute(model);`,
where `model.setLastFedDateFishes(tankToFeed, formattedDate);` will be called.

The `setLastFedDateFishes(tankToFeed, formattedDate)` function will be called down the chain of classes
[`ModelManager` -> `Tank` -> `AddressBook` -> `UniqueFishList`].

`UniqueFishList#setLastFedDateFishes(String newDate)` will then call
`internalList.stream().forEach(fish -> fish.setLastFedDate(newDate));`,
creating a new stream from `internalList` containing references to all Fish objects in `internalList`.

Every `Fish` object will call `fish.setLastFedDate(newDate)`, where a new `LastFedDate` object with the updated date
will be created and replace the `Fish`'s `lastFedDate` field.


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th fish in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new fish. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the fish was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the fish being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
